For this code challenge I built a full stack website that uses React for the client hosted on Github Pages, PHP on the backend hosted on Heroku, and a MYSQL database hosted on AWS RDS. I created a basic API with PHP which I have never used and shown the ability to use AWS as my last interviewers requested. Because this is a "full" project I am using it as my submission for this question.';
